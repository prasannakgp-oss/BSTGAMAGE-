# How to Run Your Website

Since we encountered issues with Node.js on your system, I have built a high-performance **Single File Website**. 

## Instructions
1.  Go to your Desktop folder: `BST`
2.  Double-click the `index.html` file.
3.  The website will open in your browser instantly.

## Features Included
-   **Modern Design**: Dark theme with "Biosystem Green" neon accents.
-   **Animations**: Smooth scroll reveals, floating particles, and hover effects.
-   **Mobile Responsive**: Works perfectly on phones and computers.
-   **Contact Links**: WhatsApp button links directly to your number (0781048790).

## Editing
You can edit the text directly in the `index.html` file using any text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.).
